### Hey there, I'm Evan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22-years-old software engineering student @ [42 Nice](https://42nice.fr/) and a co-founder & developer @ [Propel](https://propel.sh/) â€“ a cloud platform built for the modern developer

## ðŸŒ± Experience
I'm a self-taught Software Engineer and Systems Administrator, but I break into many different fields and Iâ€™m fairly knowledgeable in most things surrounding servers, networking, and software. Making tools and services that make lives easier or better in some way is what I love to do.

My Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) â€“ Used for developing UI.
- [Go](https://go.dev/) â€“ Primarily used for developing socket services, APIs and distribution at scale, initially learned to replace my C/C++ usage.
- [TypeScript/Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Python](https://python.org) â€“ Used for developing misc services that don't need to be in Go.

Currently learning

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) â€“ Mostly for it's world-class concurrency and scalability as well as it's "let it crash" philosophy.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) â€“ So I can flex it.
